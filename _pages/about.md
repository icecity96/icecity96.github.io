I am an assistant professor at Faculty of Computing, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT). I received the Ph.D. degree in software engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2023. I has received the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Nomination Award from Harbin Institute of Technology, and the Outstanding Doctoral Award from CCF Specialized Committee on Service Computing. My research interests include service computing, graph structure learning, graph neural networks and graph foundation model.
